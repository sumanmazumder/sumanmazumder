### Hello Everyone! I'm Suman.👋 From brush strokes to code lines, I have been blending my artistry into top-tier Frontend Development over a decade.

### Here is how I spent my 10 years in the world of Technologies!!
I stepped into the world of Tech by taking a course on UI/UX and Graphics Design from IGNOU, in 2012. Within 2 years, my enthusiastic explorer mind taught me fair enough to land a job as a Web Designer at SZI Technologies, Kolkata. 🚀 <br />
Within 3 years, I became a self-taught developer proficient in Photoshop, XD and frontend technologis like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and CSS Frameworks. I developed responsive websites from their design files and create their UI/UX functionalities. 🌟 <br />
I joined as a Senior Frontend Developer at Magicmind Technologies, where I upskilled myself with Frontend frameworks, API integrations, Form validations with User authentication and many more. 💖 <br />
After 5 years, I joined Tier5 Technologies as a UI Developer, where I worked on an in-house project that opened new horizons of challenging work environments, allowing me to leverage my skills and personality.💖 <br />
